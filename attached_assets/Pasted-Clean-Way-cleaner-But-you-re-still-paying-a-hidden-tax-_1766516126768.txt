Clean. Way cleaner.
But you’re still paying a hidden tax: your layout is stacked instead of layered.

Right now the screen reads like:

Top HUD

Table area

Bidding panel

Player identity block

Card hand

Five separate “bands.” Mobile hates bands.
Mobile wants layers — foreground, midground, background.

Here’s how to take this from “working” to “inevitable.”

1. Collapse the “You” identity block into the card row

That “You / Sort” bar is stealing vertical real estate and not earning it.

Do this instead:

Move “Sort” to a floating icon on the right edge of the card fan

Move “You / Your Team” to a tiny tag above the card fan (like a caption)

Remove the gold box entirely

You instantly win ~40px of clean space.

2. Shrink the bidding panel by ~15–20% height

Not the buttons — the container.

Right now it's too tall because:

It has top padding

It sits on full background

It has large margin above “You”

The solution:
Make the sheet tighter and let the buttons breathe.

Think of the iOS home indicator area: slim, intentional.

3. Add a subtle blur behind the bidding panel

Notice how your panel currently looks stuck on top, like a card on a table.

You want it to feel like it lives in the same visual world.

Add:

12–20px blur

5%–8% brightness lift

Very faint noise like the table texture

This creates the Apple Arcade softness.

4. Re-center the table area

The middle third of the screen (“Partner / CPU1 / CPU2 / Beat X”) still feels like dead space.
That’s not because there’s too much empty area — it’s because the content isn’t aligned to the moment.

What you want:

Partner label at top-center

CPU labels left-right, visually aligned

“Beat X or pass” sitting closer to the bidding sheet to unify them

Bring them down ~60–80px. This connects the eye flow.

5. Card fan still needs a tiny lift

Right now they’re usable, but they feel attached to the bottom.

Give them a 12–14px lift with a soft shadow behind.
This makes them feel like a physical fan resting above the UI, not inside it.

Also:
Reduce the angle of the fan slightly — the outer cards feel too tilted.

6. Consider snapping the bidding panel to two positions

This is optional, but high impact.

Case A — “Compact”
Panel sits just above the card row. Cards fully visible.

Case B — “Expanded”
Panel slides up 20% for reading clarity. Cards still visible but slightly compressed.

This adds dynamism and solves all future UI conflicts.

7. Your color noise background might be too intense

Zoom in: the static-like texture behind the table area looks heavy on mobile.

Tone down by 30–40%.
Your cards + panel should be the heroes, not the noise.

Softer = higher perceived polish.

Overall

This is very close.
You’re one pass away from a UI that feels Apple Arcade–grade.

If you want, I can sketch the exact spacing + hierarchy as a blueprint:

px values

margins

snap heights

opacity levels

shadow tokens

Just send one more screenshot where the entire screen (top to bottom) is visible and I’ll lay the full spec on top of it.

the cards need to be better legible though. maybe slightly bigger?

Bigger cards alone won’t fix legibility.
Bigger cards will just steal more vertical space and force you back into the clutter you just escaped.

The real move is this:

Make each card “readable at a glance” without making the whole row taller.

That’s a design problem, not a size problem.

Here’s how you solve it with taste:

1. Increase rank contrast, not card size

Right now the rank (K, 10, 2, A…) sits too close to the suit icon, same weight, same color intensity.

On a dense card row, the eye needs a hook.

Fix:

Rank: 2–3px larger, bold or semi-bold

Suit: 1–2px smaller, lighter or outlined

Darken the background behind the rank by 8–12% (micro gradient)

Increase color saturation of suits slightly

This creates instant scanning clarity.

You gain legibility without consuming space.

2. Use adaptive scaling

This is huge.
On mobile, you don’t need static-size cards.

Use:

Min width (for 10+ cards in hand)

Max width (for 5–6 cards)

Smooth scale between

Apple Arcade does this everywhere: the UI responds to hand size.

Your current size is “one-size-fits-none.”

3. Lift the card face off the background

Right now the card body and the playfield background are too similar in luminance.

Add:

Soft drop shadow (4–6px blur, 20–30% opacity)

Slight rim light at the card edges

2° rotation variance (tiny, but adds depth)

This makes the card row feel like a physical fan sitting above the UI.

Legibility comes from separation, not size.

4. Improve the fan curve

Your fan curve is slightly too steep.
Outer cards tilt so far they become harder to read.

Flatten the curve by 10–15%.
The hand suddenly reads like a line, not a parabola.

Much easier for the brain to scan.

5. Add a “hover/lift” on press

When the user touches a card:

It scales up by 8–12%

Lifts forward

Straightens a bit

Suit + rank brighten

You give users a “zoom” moment without permanently making cards huge.

6. The nuclear option: two-row fan (only when needed)

If the hand gets crazy (10–13 cards), you can:

Keep top row smaller

Bottom row larger

Seamless animation when a player selects a card (it lifts to the front row)

This is the Arcade+ version if you want maximum clarity without increasing the vertical footprint.

What I’d do first (low effort, maximum impact):

Increase rank font size by ~12–14%

Slightly reduce suit size

Add subtle shadow under cards

Flatten the fan by ~10%

Add press-to-enlarge interaction

This alone makes your hand instantly readable.
